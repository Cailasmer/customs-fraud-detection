Fraudulent import declarations threaten economies, national security, and public safety by causing revenue losses, enabling unfair competition, and facilitating illicit goods trafficking. 
This project addresses these issues by developing a customs fraud detection model using machine learning. 
Employing the XGBoost algorithm for training and CTGAN for synthetic data generation, the model effectively identifies fraudulent activities in import declarations.
Combining real and synthetic data enhances its accuracy and scalability, equipping customs authorities to combat fraud and protect economies and communities.
